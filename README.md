# DishOut

## Description 

DishOut is an application aimed to help users find recipes for ingredients that have been
stuck unused in their pantries or fridge. 

Our team was motivated to create this app, because we ourselves are faces with this 
problem of not wanting to waste food, money, or our shelf space. So, we wanted to 
create a platform where we could search based on the ingredients we had or wanted to use, 
and not be bombarded with 100s of results. Our goal was to keep it simple and streamlined. 

In DishOut you are able to search on our Food Page or Drink Page based of your ingredients and receive
5 recipe hits back. It displays 5 cards with the dish title and a picture. If it looks good, users car click on the image to reveal the ingredients and directions or a link to the directions. 
Or users can select our House Special Page to get a random meal and drink recipe. 

We built this project to challenge ourselves to use and learn new technologies, and to build a 
solution our user stories.
